# Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

This project builds a hybrid movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 100k dataset. It combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to generate personalized movie recommendations.

The system includes baseline models, user–item interaction–based recommenders, and content-driven recommendations using movie metadata. These are combined into a hybrid model to improve recommendation quality and handle challenges such as data sparsity and cold-start cases.

The project focuses on building an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline with clear evaluation and a simple interactive web demo.

## Features
- Baseline recommendation models
- Collaborative filtering using user–item interactions
- Content-based recommendations using movie metadata
- Hybrid model combining collaborative and content-based scores
